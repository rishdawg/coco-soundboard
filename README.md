# Sound Board Android App

An Android sound board application that displays a matrix of buttons, each triggering a different sound when tapped. The app is built with Kotlin using the MVVM architecture pattern.

## Features

- Interactive grid of sound buttons
- Low-latency sound playback using SoundPool
- Haptic feedback when buttons are pressed
- Customizable button colors
- Responsive design with RecyclerView and GridLayoutManager
- Lifecycle-aware audio resource management

## Project Structure

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

- **Data**: Models and repositories for sound data
- **UI**: Activities, adapters, and ViewModels for the user interface
- **Services**: Audio playback service using SoundPool
- **Utils**: Helper classes for haptic feedback and other utilities

## Development Status

The project is currently in Phase 1 of development, with the following components implemented:

- ✅ Framework Selection (Kotlin + Android SDK)
- ✅ Architecture Pattern (MVVM with LiveData)
- ✅ UI Components (RecyclerView with GridLayoutManager)
- ✅ Audio System (SoundPool for efficient sound playback)
- ✅ Data Structure (Sound data model)
- ✅ State Management (ViewModel with LiveData)
- ✅ Haptic Feedback

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator

## Future Development

Future phases of development will include:

- Enhanced UI with animations
- Settings screen for customization
- Sound recording capability
- Cloud synchronization
- Additional sound packs
